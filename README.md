# Stock_Price_Time_Series_Forecasting
 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Network  Objective: The project aims to predict the future adjusted closing prices of a stock using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.  Workflow: 1. Data Collection:     - The historical adjusted closing prices of a stock are collected from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.    - The data is stored in a CSV file for future reference.  2. Data Preprocessing:    - The collected data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame and only the 'Date' and 'Adj Close' columns are retained.    - The data is scaled using Min-Max scaling to normalize the values between 0 and 1.  3. Model Building:    - The LSTM neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow Keras.    - The input sequences and corresponding output values are created for training the model.    - The data is split into training, validation, and testing sets.  4. Model Training:    - The model is trained on the training set and validated on the validation set.    - Different combinations of optimizers and loss functions are experimented with to find the best performing model.    - The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.  5. Model Evaluation:    - The trained model is evaluated on the validation set to assess its performance.    - The evaluation metrics are calculated and printed to analyze the model's accuracy.  6. Future Price Prediction:    - The trained model is used to predict the future adjusted closing prices of the stock.    - The prediction horizon is extended by a specified number of time steps.    - The predicted prices are inverse transformed to get the actual price values.  7. Results Visualization:    - The historical and predicted prices are plotted on a graph to visualize the model's performance.    - The graph displays the historical prices along with the predicted prices for the future time steps.  Dependencies: - pandas for data manipulation - yfinance for fetching historical stock data - matplotlib for visualization - TensorFlow for building and training the LSTM model - scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics  References: - [YFinance Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) - [TensorFlow Keras Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) - [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)
